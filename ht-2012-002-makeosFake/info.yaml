description: "The resulting file is actually an application with a modified icon to resemble a real document. The target must have the system configured to not show the extension of the file and have to open the file pretending to be a document  (social-engineering attack)<br><br><b>Attack:</b> The target must open the fake document file in order to install the backdoor.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The document you select to be used will be displayed to the target and the original application is deleted. Only the document will remain after the infection. This is a very clever social engineering attack<br><br><b>Platform:</b> Mac OS X<br><br><b>Tested with:</b><br>Mac OS X 10.5.x, 10.6.x"
